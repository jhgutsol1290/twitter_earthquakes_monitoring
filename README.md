# Mexico City Earthquakes Twitter Monitoring and Alexa Skill

Tweets from SASMEX Twitter account will be monitored, so that when an earthquake occurs that would affect Mexico City and the alarms are activated, we will receive the tweet and process it to AWS DynamoDB using DynamoDB streams so that we would be able to trigger an Alexa skill and also keep track of the events (earthquakes) that have occurred.

Flow Chart of the project:
